# WGAN_GP
Keras model and tensorflow optimization of 'improved Training of Wasserstein GANs'

only still coding normal Wasserstein GAN

in the parser, default learning rate set 1e-4 (both for generator and for discriminator), but now set 5e-5 manually for Disc, 1e-5 for Gen of original Wasserstein optimizer

Gradient Penalty (proposed in the paper) is now under inplemention, please wait
